# Zixin Xu's MSc project

Code and related material for Zixin's MSc project to compare the 2D line transect (2DLT) method and the double-observer (DO) method for estimating ungulate abundance.
The 2DLT method is in the pacage LT2D authored by Cal Fagard-Jenkin. See the file "install_LT2D.R" for code to install the package.
The file "simtest.R" illustrates a simple simulation and fitting using the package, while the file "primatefit.R" fits to a real primate survey dataset that is included in the LT2D package.
